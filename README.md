This started out a few years ago as a project to keep my programming chops up while unemployed. The programming focus was on learning:

* the Phalcon framework,
* to capture a Twitter stream,
* more machine learning techniques to do things with the data,
* more about OO code design,
* to use existing PHP and Javascript libraries where possible.

This is a work in progress but is fully functional. This code uses a more streamlined process to connect to Twitter than *fennb/phirehose* or *OwlyCode/StreamingBird*.

It requires PHP7, Phalcon, and the extension “Ds” available with PEAR. It is currently running on Nginx, PHP 7.1 , and Phalcon 3.3.
