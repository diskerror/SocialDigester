This started out a few years ago as a project to keep my programming chops up. The programming focus was on learning:

* the [Phalcon](https://phalconphp.com/) framework,
* to capture a [Twitter](https://twitter.com) stream,
* more machine learning techniques to do things with the data,
* more about OO code design,
* to use existing PHP and Javascript libraries where possible.

This is a work in progress but is fully functional. This code uses a more streamlined process to connect to Twitter than [*fennb/phirehose*](https://github.com/fennb/phirehose) or [*OwlyCode/StreamingBird*](https://github.com/OwlyCode/StreamingBird).

It requires PHP7, Phalcon, Composer, and the extension “Ds” available with PEAR. It is currently running on an AWS instance with Debian 8, Nginx 1.12, PHP 7.2, and Phalcon 3.3.
