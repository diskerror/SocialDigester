This started out a few years ago as a project to keep my programming chops up while unemployed. The programming focus was on learning:

* the Phalcon framework,
* to capture a Twitter stream,
* more machine learning techniques to do things with the data,
* more about OO code design,
* to use existing PHP and Javascript libraries where possible.

This is a work in progress but is fully functional. This code uses a more streamlined process to connect to Twitter than *fennb/phirehose* or *OwlyCode/StreamingBird*, but I'm not yet convinced my version is more stable. Itâ€˜s just simpler.

It started out on PHP 5.6 but is currently running on Nginx, PHP 7.1 , and Phalcon 3.3.
